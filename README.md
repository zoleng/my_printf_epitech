# my_printf_epitech
I recreated the printf function
It handle all the flags plus a %b formating flag, which prints unsigned numbers in a binary base.
A %S formating flag, which prints a character string (like %s). However, non-printablecharacters (ASCII value strictly smaller than 32 or greater or equal than 127) must be represented by a back-slash to be followed by the characterâ€™s value in octal base.

USAGE :

-> make re

creat a libmy.a wich is the lib created specifically for the print
